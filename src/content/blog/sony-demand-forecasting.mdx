# Building AI-Driven Demand Forecasting at Sony

At Sony, I had the opportunity to work on a critical demand forecasting initiative that directly impacted supply chain optimization across the organization. This post details my experience developing the **Focus model** — a specialized component of our enterprise forecasting toolkit.

## The Challenge

Enterprise demand forecasting at scale presents unique challenges:

- **Volume**: Processing predictions for millions of SKUs across multiple regions
- **Complexity**: Handling promotional lifts, seasonality, and market dynamics
- **Accuracy**: Maintaining prediction quality while scaling infrastructure
- **Integration**: Connecting with existing supply chain and inventory systems

Traditional statistical methods were struggling to capture the nuanced patterns in promotional data, leading to either overstocking during promotions or stockouts that frustrated customers.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview

The solution was built on **Azure Databricks**, leveraging its distributed computing capabilities:

```
Data Sources → Delta Lake → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Predictions → API Layer
```

Key technology choices:
- **PySpark** for distributed data processing
- **Delta Lake** for reliable data storage with ACID transactions
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model versioning
- **Azure Data Factory** for orchestration

### The Focus Model

The Focus model specifically targets promotional demand patterns. Unlike standard time series approaches, it:

1. **Separates baseline from promotional lift** — Treating these as distinct signals
2. **Learns promotional elasticity** — How different promotion types affect demand
3. **Incorporates external factors** — Competitor actions, economic indicators
4. **Handles cold-start products** — Using hierarchical features for new SKUs

### Feature Engineering Pipeline

The feature engineering pipeline processes daily:
- Historical sales data (3 years rolling)
- Promotional calendars and metadata
- Inventory levels and stockout history
- External market indicators

## Key Outcomes

After deployment, the Focus model delivered measurable improvements:

- **Improved forecast accuracy** during promotional periods
- **Reduced inventory holding costs** through better demand signals
- **Faster promotion planning** with automated what-if scenarios
- **Scalable architecture** supporting international expansion

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Starting with a clear baseline** — We benchmarked against existing methods before adding complexity
2. **Modular design** — The Focus model could be updated independently of the broader pipeline
3. **Close collaboration with domain experts** — Supply chain planners provided invaluable feedback

### Challenges Faced

1. **Data quality issues** — Promotional metadata was inconsistent across regions
2. **Model interpretability** — Stakeholders needed to understand why predictions changed
3. **Deployment complexity** — Coordinating updates across multiple environments

## Looking Forward

This project reinforced the importance of building ML systems that prioritize:
- **Maintainability** over complexity
- **Interpretability** alongside accuracy
- **Operational excellence** from day one

The techniques developed here have applications beyond retail — anywhere demand prediction meets promotional dynamics.
